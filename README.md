# Altitude Pro Child Theme

This is my personal repository of the [Altitude Pro Theme by StudioPress](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/altitude/). I use this repository to maintain any edits I make to the theme while also allowing for future updates of the master theme.

## Methodology
The `master` branch always maintains the latest version of the theme available for download from [StudioPress.com](http://studiopress.com). Any time I start a new project using this theme, I create a branch for the project.

## Usage
This repository is intended only for my private development and for public demonstration purposes only. If you want to use the [Altitude Pro Theme](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/altitude/) in your project, visit the [StudioPress website](http://studiopress.com) and purchase a copy.
