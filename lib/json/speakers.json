		"bio": "Kevin Poulsen is a former hacker who was once wanted by the FBI. He was featured on NBC's Unsolved Mysteries, and was arrested in April 1991 after 18 months on the run. He pleaded guilty to computer intrusion and served a little over five years in prison. At the time, it was the longest US sentence ever given for cybercrime.\n\nFollowing his release from prison, Poulsen was briefly barred from using computers. Reformed, but still possessed of the curiosity that contributed to him cracking systems when he was younger, he became a journalist. His first magazine feature ran in WIRED in 1998, and covered computer programmers who were driven to survivalist tactics by fear of the looming Y2K bug.\n\nWhen Poulsen's court supervision expired, he joined a California-based web start-up called SecurityFocus as editorial director in 2000, and began reporting security and cybercrime news.  Poulsen repeatedly broke stories of national importance that were picked up by the mainstream press:  a computer intrusion at a US hospital that, for the first time, breached patient medical records; hackers \"war driving\" for open Wi-Fi networks; a computer virus crippling a safety system at a nuclear power plant in Ohio; a southern California hacker's successful penetration of a Secret Service agent's PDA, and the attendant theft of confidential agency files.\n\nPoulsen left SecurityFocus in 2005 and joined Wired.com, where he serves as investigations editor at Wired, working on cybercrime, privacy and political coverage. In a computer-assisted reporting effort in 2006, Poulsen wrote software that scoured MySpace for registered sex offenders, identifying hundreds. The story resulted in the arrest of an active pedophile, led to significant policy changes at MySpace and spawned federal legislation. In 2007, Poulsen's reporting revealed that the FBI had been using a custom spyware program, called a CIPAV, to infect the computers of criminal suspects. In June 2010, Poulsen and a co-writer broke the news that the government had secretly arrested a young Army intelligence analyst in Iraq for leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents to the secret-spilling website WikiLeaks.\n\nPoulsen is the founding editor of *Wired's Threat Level* blog, which won the 2008 Knight-Batten Award for Innovation in Journalism, and the 2010 MIN award for best blog. In 2009 Poulsen was inducted into MIN's Digital Hall of Fame for online journalism, and in 2010 he was among those honored as a \"Top Cyber Security Journalist\" in a peer-voted award by the SANS Institute.  He is the author of *Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime Underground*. (Crown, 2011)",

		"title": "May I Have Your Retention? Managing Today's Information Security Professionals",
		"abstract": "Ask a security leader what they need to be successful, and people will likely be the answer. There's a lot being said about the lack of qualified people in the security industry, which is often conflated with talent. What is the next-generation workforce (NGWF) seeking in their career? Let's ask several higher education programs' students what their expectations of employment are and what they believe they can bring to the job. Now that you have them, since money only goes so far, what works for retention? If they don't have the skills you desire, but show promise, what are some viable options to help advance their career so the security program can be successful? Are we looking at the right qualities in employees when hiring? Can you spot a diamond in the rough? This session will go through what's top-of-mind with new hire security employees as well as insight into career growth tactics to help with retention.\n\n- Independent research from students entering the security field and their expectations in the workforce\n\n- You have them, now how do you retain them (aside from money)\n\n- Rethinking the skills mix – what other options exist\n\n- Low to no cost investments in security professionals when there is next to no budget\n\n- No budget for you; realigning and shuffling to effectively use resources"

		"bio": "Francesco 'Frank' Trama is Co-Founder and Chief Security Architect & Evangelist at PacketViper, a perimeter security solutions company.  Based in Pittsburgh, PA PacketViper provides Advanced IP Filtering software.  He is steeped in hands-on network security & engineering experience.  Mr. Trama’s early career was spent in Pittsburgh performing network engineering, assessment and security design for companies such as Xerox Connect, Bayer and Compucom. Mr. Trama has developed acute subject matter expertise in network security, cyber security operations & telecommunications.\n\nPacketViper began when Mr. Trama was working as a Director in the network operations department of a large distribution company.  He identified a functional gap that network security designs had either overlooked or not taken seriously.  Inundated with alerts, understaffed and frustrated by limitations of existing network security technologies, Frank asked a simple question, “Why is my infrastructure handling so much illegitimate traffic that I have absolutely no purpose for?” He posed this question to a trusted consultant and together they developed PacketViper Advanced IP Filtering software and revolutionized perimeter security.\n\nMr. Trama is a decorated US Army veteran, with over 10 active years served with an assault helicopter battalion.  Frank speaks at security conferences across the country to help network security managers deal with ongoing security challenges at the perimeter.  He is a graduate of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and an active member of multiple cyber security focused professional organizations.",
		"title": "Addressing the Hidden Killer in Network Security",
		"abstract": "The volume of traffic hitting our essential network security infrastructure is unprecedented.  Furthermore, a large percentage of that traffic is illegitimate, increasing cyber security risk and creating alerts, logs and management work that can bring a network security team to its knees.  Traffic volume increases costs associated with volume licensing, bandwidth and needlessly drives up device utilization and threat exposure.  While many network security managers have resigned themselves to accepting this traffic as a reality of today’s business climate, there is a better way. Recent advances in IP filtering at the perimeter can help address this root cause problem facing network security managers today and better manage the volume, variety and velocity of traffic.  This session will cover the challenges of excessive traffic and the benefits of understanding the true context around the IP.  A case study will be reviewed discussing the benefits and ROI of increasing the percent of legitimate network traffic using PacketViper advanced IP filtering."

		"title": "Power Plays: Russia, Ukraine, Crimea, and SCADA",
		"abstract": "The electric grid in Ukraine suffered multiple simultaneous outages in December 2015, and analysis from industry experts and the U.S. government points to a hostile Russian cyber attack as the cause. This talk will walk you through the incident and the forensic evidence, and then take a step back to look at the big picture. What factors led the hackers to pull the trigger? Could this type of attack happen here in the United States?"
