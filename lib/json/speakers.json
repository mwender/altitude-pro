		"bio": "Kevin Poulsen is a former hacker who was once wanted by the FBI. He was featured on NBC's Unsolved Mysteries, and was arrested in April 1991 after 18 months on the run. He pleaded guilty to computer intrusion and served a little over five years in prison. At the time, it was the longest US sentence ever given for cybercrime.\n\nFollowing his release from prison, Poulsen was briefly barred from using computers. Reformed, but still possessed of the curiosity that contributed to him cracking systems when he was younger, he became a journalist. His first magazine feature ran in WIRED in 1998, and covered computer programmers who were driven to survivalist tactics by fear of the looming Y2K bug.\n\nWhen Poulsen's court supervision expired, he joined a California-based web start-up called SecurityFocus as editorial director in 2000, and began reporting security and cybercrime news.  Poulsen repeatedly broke stories of national importance that were picked up by the mainstream press:  a computer intrusion at a US hospital that, for the first time, breached patient medical records; hackers \"war driving\" for open Wi-Fi networks; a computer virus crippling a safety system at a nuclear power plant in Ohio; a southern California hacker's successful penetration of a Secret Service agent's PDA, and the attendant theft of confidential agency files.\n\nPoulsen left SecurityFocus in 2005 and joined Wired.com, where he serves as investigations editor at Wired, working on cybercrime, privacy and political coverage. In a computer-assisted reporting effort in 2006, Poulsen wrote software that scoured MySpace for registered sex offenders, identifying hundreds. The story resulted in the arrest of an active pedophile, led to significant policy changes at MySpace and spawned federal legislation. In 2007, Poulsen's reporting revealed that the FBI had been using a custom spyware program, called a CIPAV, to infect the computers of criminal suspects. In June 2010, Poulsen and a co-writer broke the news that the government had secretly arrested a young Army intelligence analyst in Iraq for leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents to the secret-spilling website WikiLeaks.\n\nPoulsen is the founding editor of *Wired's Threat Level* blog, which won the 2008 Knight-Batten Award for Innovation in Journalism, and the 2010 MIN award for best blog. In 2009 Poulsen was inducted into MIN's Digital Hall of Fame for online journalism, and in 2010 he was among those honored as a \"Top Cyber Security Journalist\" in a peer-voted award by the SANS Institute.  He is the author of *Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime Underground*. (Crown, 2011)",

		"bio": "Betsy Woudenberg is founder and CEO of IntelligenceArts, a security consulting firm based in the Washington DC area. She is a former U.S. Intelligence officer with experience in cyber operations and telecommunications and is an internationally recognized expert on the human and technical risk factors in critical infrastructure security.\n\nMs. Woudenberg\u2019s early career was in Silicon Valley, working for game companies and software startups. She joined the Central Intelligence Agency as a member of CIA\u2019s first post-9/11 class of case officers.\n\nHer work at CIA focused on applying her experience in the business world to conduct non-traditional operations against national security targets. As a case officer, reports officer, and targeting officer, Ms. Woudenberg learned the end-to-end craft of intelligence collection, from defining collection requirements to designing operations to gathering and shaping reports that addressed the needs and interests of U.S. policymakers. Ms. Woudenberg also developed subject matter expertise in cyber operations, telecommunications, and counterintelligence.\n\nHer specialty is interpreting highly technical topics for non-technical audiences. She teaches at USCYBERCOM, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and internationally about SCADA\u2014the control systems that run our critical infrastructure\u2014and Stuxnet, the first known successful kinetic cyber-weapon.\n\nAfter ten years applying a corporate perspective to the intelligence community, Ms. Woudenberg now brings the benefit of this experience back to the business world. She helps clients understand the motivations and capabilities of nation-state adversaries and how sophisticated attackers exploit both human and cyber vulnerabilities to bypass conventional corporate security countermeasures. \n\nShe speaks at security conferences across the country to help private sector audiences understand global threats, using publicly known cyber and espionage cases to illustrate how adversaries are evolving and adapting their tactics. She views security from the perspective of the adversary, and helps her clients shape a holistic protection strategy that leverages human, physical, and cyber resources. Ms. Woudenberg is a graduate of Stanford University.",

		"abstract": "The electric grid in Ukraine suffered multiple simultaneous outages in December 2015, and analysis from industry experts and the U.S. government points to a hostile Russian cyber attack as the cause. This talk will walk you through the incident and the forensic evidence, and then take a step back to look at the big picture. What factors led the hackers to pull the trigger? Could this type of attack happen here in the United States?"
