In the past decade, media and entertainment companies have embraced digital technologies that help them not only create and deliver their products in new and compelling ways, but also collect, store and use a massive amount of data to gain deeper insights into their customers. Multi-service and multi-protocol delivery over IP to consumer-owned devices such as smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and PCs is essential today. Delivery of content becomes direct and personalized based on extensive analytics of viewer data. All this opens up significant new risks that could lead content, data, and business systems to be compromised. And those risks, if not mitigated, represent a true existential threat.

But despite the local effects of cybercrime, cyber actors often wreak havoc without ever meeting or interacting with their intended victims, whether the target is a Fortune 500 company or a lone individual.  Operating from afar, these malicious actors simply exploit network vulnerabilities or compromise the PII and banking information of entire groups of people without having to witness to the force and effects of their actions.  These relatively impersonal aspects of cybercrime often leave many victims asking why they were targeted and what must be done to avoid another attack—questions that law enforcement is left to answer.\n\nOther times, however, cyber actors are fixtures in victims’ lives—the disgruntled former employee or the jilted friend out for revenge.  At the United States Department of Justice, Senior Trial Attorney Tim Flowers has witnessed cybercrime on both its grandest and most granular scale.  In his capacity as a federal prosecutor, he has overseen the investigation and prosecution of cyber actors located both home and abroad, learning valuable lessons in the process.  His talk will focus on current trends in cybercrime, from the growing influence of organized crime to lone individuals leveraging the trust of their targets for ill-gotten gains.

    "abstract": "Why do corporate breaches continue to succeed? Corporate breaches continue to succeed because attackers are able to steal the legitimate identities of your employees and use those identities to attack your infrastructure. Far deadlier than malware based attacks, identity based attacks can go undetected for months or years because perpetrators impersonate the methods used by your various privileged accounts as if they were that user. Attackers have changed their methods from the now outdated malware based attacks to the evolved identity based attacks. Learn how analytics, deception, and data streams are saving the security industry, or would have at least saved the Democratic National Committee.",

Legacy approaches to cyber security, which rely on knowledge of past attacks, are simply not sufficient to combat new, evolving attacks, and no human cyber analyst can watch so much or react quickly enough. A fundamentally new approach to cyber defense is needed to detect and investigate these threats that are already inside the network - before they turn into a full-blown crisis.\n\nSelf-learning systems represent a fundamental step-change in automated cyber defense, are relied upon by organizations around the world, and can cover up to millions of devices. Based on unsupervised machine learning and probabilistic mathematics, these new approaches to security can establish a highly accurate understanding of normal behavior by learning an organization’s ‘pattern of life,’. They can therefore spot abnormal activity as it emerges and even take precise, measured actions to automatically curb the threat.\n\nDiscover why unsupervised machine learning is the future of defense and how the ‘immune system’ approach to cyber security provides complete network visibility and the ability to prioritize threats in order to better allocate time and resources.\n\nIn this session, learn:\n- How new machine learning and mathematics are automating advanced cyber defense\n- Why full network visibility allows you to detect threats as or before they emerge\n- How smart prioritization and visualization of threats allows for better resource allocation and lower risk\n- Real-world examples of unknown threats detected by ‘immune system’ technology",

The thing that affects our ability to learn isn’t always intelligence, it’s often curiosity.\n\nCuriosity is what drives us towards the pursuit of knowledge. It’s what stimulates our ability to learn and close information gaps in a way that is holistically critical for our career development as well as for our day-to-day success.

I’ll describe information gap theory and the components that comprise curiosity.

Despite spending over $86 billion dollars last year data breaches have not stopped. In fact, they have increased in both frequency and size. It is time to move away from an attack focus and start focusing on the data and the very users who access that critical data.\n\nWe will demonstrate how a human-centric security approach can give you greater visibility and control into user behavior and cloud application usage to assess and control risks, Providing the safeguards for users to be productive on any device while shielding corporations from risk, and protecting vital data with advanced real-time protection to ensure data is not compromised. We will show how you companies are going beyond simply blocking a file from leaving through a channel, to gaining unrivaled visibility into users’ actions and context around the user behavior. Whether it is to better understand how employees are handling critical data or to expedite investigations we will exhibit how forensic tools and over the shoulder video monitoring allows you to mitigate risks and demonstrate security controls. These threats range from a compromised system, stolen credentials, malicious insiders or unintentional acts. See the precursors to a data incident long before it becomes an incident.

It has become indispensable for enterprises to keep track of the active cloud applications in the network for detecting malice. With that, threats from malicious insiders, attackers and naive users are increasing that are putting organizations at risk.\n\nGenerally speaking, cloud applications have not been not effectively managed in the enterprises as IT departments do not have robust mechanisms to detect insecurities persisting in the cloud applications. As a result, enterprises are encountering a problem of Shadow IT, a terminology used for highlighting devices and unauthorized applications that remain activated under the radar of the IT department. Shadow IT renders organizations more vulnerable to cyber attacks because Shadow IT infrastructure is not monitored by organizations for detecting potential threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, to address Shadow IT, it is not merely sufficient to discover what SaaS applications are running, but to understand how enterprise ready those applications are from a security, risk, and compliance perspective — specifically with regard to the precise needs of your organization.

    "abstract": "This presentation will highlight the newest and leading innovation in dynamic perimeter defense that ensures that attackers never see the same perimeter twice as they scan and probe a network.\n\nAs firewalls, NGFWs and IDS/IPS have evolved in their processing of application layer inspections, the epidemic of rising global IP traffic volume has made it less practical and secure to perform these deep packet inspections as a first line of defense.  A common predicament today is that while only legitimate traffic should make it to the firewall inspection process, efficiently stripping away illegitimate traffic is not the primary purpose of firewalls.  As such, a major problem remains unsolved for most network administrators, resulting in increased risks and overall network security costs.\n\nPacketViper’s Virtual Minefield Zone (VMZ) solves the global IP traffic volume problem while turning the tables on the attacker by using the network terrain to give the advantage back to the network administrator. The VMZ gathers new intelligence with deception-based sensors, traps, and decoys that both deceive and better detect attackers, preventing more malicious attacks. Firewalls and SIEMs perform better as a result. Typical customers reduce network traffic up to 70%.",
