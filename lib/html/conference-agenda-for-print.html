			<h5>Combating Cybercrime at the Frontlines</h5>
			<p>Payton discusses why investment in Cybersecurity across industries has not eliminated attacks and breaches. She outlines three types of companies: those breached; those about to be breached; and those who don't know they’ve been breached. With solutions on how companies can better secure their assets, Payton helps avoid negative impacts to your bottom line with insights on and strategies to manage emerging trends.
			In addition, she will be addressing the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Global look @cybersecurity</li>
				<li>Forward looking</li>
				<li>Behind the headlines, what’s not being said about cyber and what it means</li>
				<li>Behind the Curtain-Lessons learned from the White House</li>
				<li>Losing line of sight of data? Instant strategies companies can use to make a difference today.</li>

			<h5>Advanced Security</h5>
			<p>The backbone of today’s products and services are increasingly being built on open source software. Service providers, for example, rely on open source hypervisors while network equipment manufacturers rely on protocol libraries, such as, OpenSSL and NTP.  While some of these codebases have existed for decades with relatively few severe vulnerabilities, security researchers are uncovering new critical vulnerabilities at an increasing rate.  Recent discoveries have rippled throughout the industry, impacting numerous products, causing consumer concern, news headlines, and increasingly, raising questions about the security integrity of critical software components.  What are the source of these vulnerabilities, and how can development teams and the industry mitigate or manage risks?  What is Cisco doing today to understand and mitigate risks in third party software?</p>

			<h5>The Department of Justice's Cybersecurity Initiatives-Investigating and Prosecuting Network Intruders in Today's Cyber Landscape</h5>
			<p>As the frequency of network intrusions grows, stakeholders must face the unique challenges of confronting intruders from inside and outside an organization.  By addressing everything from file exfiltration at small businesses to large-scale data breaches at major corporations, the Department of Justice has been at the forefront of identifying and prosecuting network intruders.  Tim Flowers, Trial Attorney at the Department's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), investigates and prosecutes cyber-related cases ranging from trade-secret theft to large-scale hacks.  Flowers will discuss relevant provisions of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act ("CISA"), how companies can work with law enforcement after experiencing a suspected intrusion, and the Department's use of its prosecutorial powers to bring network intruders to justice.  Flowers will also discuss CCIPS's efforts to engage businesses, regardless of their sizes, about communicating suspected intrusions to law enforcement.</p>
