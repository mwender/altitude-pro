    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/brandon_bruce">Brandon Bruce</a> is COO &amp; Co-founder of <a href="https://www.cirrusinsight.com/">Cirrus Insight</a>, a sales software company in Knoxville, Tennessee that was #41 on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing U.S. companies in 2016. Brandon got his first computer, a Macintosh Classic, in middle school. He built his first website with friends in high school in 1995. Brandon graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara (the third node on ARPAnet) in 1999 â€“ not long before its powerful computers were co-opted in a massive DDOS attack that brought down Yahoo, eBay, Amazon, and others. Brandon enjoys cycling and once raced his bicycle 508 miles across Death Valley. He finished in 35 hours and 7 minutes.
