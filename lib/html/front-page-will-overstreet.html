    <p>Will Overstreet always gave the University of Tennessee Vols the EDGE by sacking the opponents' quarterbacks.</p>

    <p>Now as the Master of Ceremonies for EDGE2016, the former linebacker-turned-entrepreneur will keep the conference running smoothly as he presents the world-class speakers to attendees.</p>

    <p>"I am very honored and excited to be emceeing the EDGE conference," Overstreet said. "Being a former defensive end, the prospect of talking about any topic on defenses always gets me excited, but in this case it is especially important because every business is under threat of attack each and every day from cyber criminals."
