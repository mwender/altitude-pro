  <h3>Presentation Guidelines</h3>
          <p>Each presentation slot will be 50-minutes. Presentations should be about 40 minutes, allowing 10 minutes for Q&amp;A. Proposal submissions will be selected in a competitive peer-review process based on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><u>Value or relevance to attendees</u></strong>. Does this abstract contain information that attendees want to hear? Is there significant value to the attendees? Is the presentation relevant to current topics? What are the practical applications of the ideas that are presented?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><u>How well does this presentation advance existing ideas and/or advance new ideas?</u></strong> Does this presentation advance existing ideas or present new ideas? Has this material been presented elsewhere where attendees may have been present?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><u>Timeliness of the focus of the presentation.</u></strong> There is no substitute for timeliness. Will the presentation be up-to-date and cutting-edge at the time of presentation in six to nine months? Will the topic have implications in the future? How relevant is the topic in the context of pending legislation, regulations and technology? Does the presentation document pre-and post-process or system changes?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><u>Did the presentation reach logical conclusions?</u></strong> Have the conclusions been supported with data? Is the data representative of the key points of the presentation? For example, have cost savings or increases been documented? Are effects to processes or outcomes measured and documented?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><u>How well are the purpose and outcomes of the session expressed</u></strong>. Is there a well-defined focus? Are referenced sources and data appropriately used? Is the writing clear, jargon-free, and coherent? The quality, completeness, and accuracy of the proposal will be a judging factor in the proposal selection process. Does the title accurately describe the presentation?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><u>Prior Experience and Communication Skills</u></strong>. Based on the clarity and language use in the proposal, is the speaker likely to deliver a lively and interesting presentation? Has the speaker documented prior speaking engagements? Do the authors have adequate and sufficient experience with the subject matter to give a presentation at this time? Do the authors have actual project or implementation experience? Does the authors’ presentation include a user perspective?</p>
